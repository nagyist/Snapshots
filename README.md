# Snapshots for Xcode

Xcode plugins don't work anymore, so you should help @antondomashnev with https://github.com/Antondomashnev/FBSnapshotsViewer

Which is the sucessor to this plugin.

### An Xcode Plugin to show the state of FBSnapshot Tests.

I think Facebook have [view testing](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) right. 
I don't think Xcode's quite there, so I built a plugin to fix it.

#### Features

* Showing new images as they're created
* Showing the differences between failed snapshot tests
* Open specific diffs in Kaleidoscope
* Turns red if you've created a view with a zero frame

#### Installation

Install via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/). In Xcode choose Window, Package Manager and search for "Snapshots". 

#### Contributing

It's actually [_way_ easier](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/) to work on Plugins than you think. Hitting run in Xcode on this project will open a new Xcode with a working lldb instance and you can work on it like any other app. Contributions are extremely welcome of course, large visual design changes should probably be talked about in an issue first FWIW.

#### Unknowns

Currently this only works if you're using XCTests or Expecta. Kiwi has it's own test runner, and I've been focusing on what I use personally.

If you're using Expecta I really recommend my buddy dB's extension for Expecta: [EXPMatchers+FBSnapshotTest](https://github.com/dblock/ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta). It automates the whole setup process + adds nice language around tests.
